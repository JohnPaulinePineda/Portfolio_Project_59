This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_59/) explores different ensemble learning approaches which combine the predictions from multiple models in an effort to achieve better predictive performance. The ensemble frameworks applied in the analysis were grouped into three classes including boosting models which add ensemble members sequentially that correct the predictions made by prior models and outputs a weighted average of the predictions; bagging models which fit many individual learners on different samples of the same dataset and averaging the predictions; and stacking or blending models which consolidate many different model types on the same data using base learners and applying a separate meta learner to learn how to best combine the predictions. Boosting models included the Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machines and Categorical Boosting algorithms. Bagging models applied were the Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, Bagged Decision Trees, Bagged Logistic Regression and Bagged Support Vector Machine algorithms. Individual base learners including the K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Ridge Classifier, Neural Network and Decision Tree algorithms were formulated with predictions stacked or blended together as contributors to the Logistic Regression meta learner. The resulting predictions derived from all ensemble learning models were evaluated based on their classification performance using the F1 Score metric.
